# HSL vs HSB (aka HSV)
(_2021/02/10_)

Yea, so... those two color spaces are VEEEERY different.

❗️❗️❗️**Lightness != Brightness** ❗️❗️❗️

_Don't mistake one for the other, or you're gonna spend the whole day trying to figure out why your math isn't working._

E.g. fully saturated Red 🔴:

* `HSL`: `Hue` = 0, `Saturation` = 100%, `Lightness` = **50%**
* `HSB`: `Hue` = 0, `Saturation` = 100%, `Brightness` = **100%**
